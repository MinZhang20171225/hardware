# [Carloop](https://www.carloop.io)
## OBD-II CAN adapter for the Particle Photon/Electron and RedBear Duo

<img src="images/Photo2_750.png" width="355">

The WiFi-capable Particle Photon or better yet the cellular Particle
Electron can turn your car into a cloud connected device!

Carloop's PCB connects your car's CAN bus network to the Photon, Electron and Duo. It also provides battery power and a GPS to track location.

# Particle Photon Example

# [Check out the Carloop Store](https://store.carloop.io/)


## Features

* High-speed CAN transceiver [adapted from the OpenXC project](https://github.com/openxc/reference-vi/blob/gh-pages/electrical/design/can.mkd)
* Get power from the OBD-II port using [a robust circuit adapted from the OpenXC project](https://github.com/openxc/reference-vi/blob/gh-pages/electrical/design/power.mkd)
* GPS connector
* Stacked components for a more compact development kit than a
traditional 90-degrees PCB mount OBD-II connector.
* Powered by the Particle platform!

## Hardware

There are a few hardware variants: [Carloop](Carloop.v2), [Carloop XL](CarloopXL.v3) and [Carloop Retro](CarloopRetro.v0).

Here are the PCB design files for the Revision 2.3, the one sold on the [Carloop store](https://store.carloop.io)

## Software

The [Carloop Library](https://github.com/carloop/carloop-library) is available on Particle's Web IDE.  You will need to flash a [Particle Photon](https://store.carloop.io/products/particle-photon), [Particle Electron](https://store.carloop.io/products/particle-electron) or [RedBear Duo](https://store.carloop.io/products/redbear-duo) with an example app which can ben found in Carloop Library.
